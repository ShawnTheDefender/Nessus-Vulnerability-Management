# Nessus Vulnerability Management | Scanning and Remediation

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to create and manage a virtual environment using VMware and Nessus Essentials. The main objective is to perform vulnerability scans, both basic and credentialed, analyze the results, and apply remediation techniques. This showcases key steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle.

## Project Objectives

1. Provisioning and deprovisioning virtual environments within VMware.
2. Running initial vulnerability scans using Nessus against VMs and observing results.
3. Running credentialed vulnerability scans and comparing/contrasting results.
4. Applying remediation techniques.

## Technologies and Protocols Used

- **VMware Workstation 16 Player**
- **Nessus Essentials**
- **Windows ISO** + **Firefox 3.6.12**

> **Note:** This lab will be conducted on a Windows machine.

## Step 5: Configure Virtual Machine

### Step 5.1: Initial Configuration

1. Let’s scan our VM to see if you get any response - later we’ll do a more powerful credential scan.
2. Go to your VM, search for `CMD` to open the command line.
3. Use `ipconfig` to get your IPv4 address.

### Step 5.2: Firewall Configuration

1. In your VM, search for `wf.msc` to open Windows Defender Firewall properties.
2. Under Domain Profile tab, Private Profile tab, and Public Profile tab, turn the firewalls OFF.

### Step 5.3: Check for Connectivity

1. On your **host** machine, open a command prompt.
2. Ping your VM's IP address obtained in the previous step.
3. With the firewalls turned off, you should receive a response indicating successful connectivity.

## Step 6: Basic Nessus Scan

1. Sign into Nessus Essentials.
2. Click "Create a new scan".
3. Under Vulnerabilities, choose "Basic Network Scan".
4. Name the scan `Windows 10 Single Host` and paste the VM's IP address in the targets field.
5. Leave the rest of the settings as default.
6. Click "Save". You should see the scan configuration on the next page.
7. Scroll over and click the play button to start the scan.
8. Wait for the scan to complete.

5. When you click on the medium severity vulnerability, you may find “SMB Signing not required”.
6. Nessus provides a description and solution for this vulnerability.
