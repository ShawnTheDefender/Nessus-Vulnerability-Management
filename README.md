# Nessus Vulnerability Management | Scanning and Remediation

## Project Description

This project demonstrates how to create and manage a virtual environment using VMware and Nessus Essentials. The main objective is to perform vulnerability scans, both basic and credentialed, analyze the results, and apply remediation techniques. This showcases key steps in the Vulnerability Management Lifecycle.

## Project Objectives

1. Provisioning and deprovisioning virtual environments within VMware.
2. Running initial vulnerability scans using Nessus against VMs and observing results.
3. Running credentialed vulnerability scans and comparing/contrasting results.
4. Applying remediation techniques.

## Technologies and Protocols Used

- **VMware Workstation 16 Player**
- **Nessus Essentials**
- **Windows ISO** + **Firefox 3.6.12**

> **Note:** This lab will be conducted on a Windows machine.
